/**
 * Leetcode: 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/
 * 
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you
 * beforehand. (i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]). 
 * 
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise 
 * return false.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
 * Output: true
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
 * Output: false
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain
 * duplicates. Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

     * Similiar Approach as ArrayRotatedSearch
     * 
     * The only problematic scenario is when the numbers at indices start, middle, and end
     * are the same, as in this case, we canâ€™t decide which part of the array is sorted. 
     * In such a case, the best we can do is to skip one number from both ends:
     * start = start + 1 & end = end - 1.
     * 
     * Time Complexity: O(LogN)
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
